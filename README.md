# VisitorCommentsApp
Visitor Comments MVC app for Robertson Cooper

The scenario:
A small business requires a simple web interface for guests/visitors to leave their personal details such as name, address, and phone number(s) in order 
that they can be contacted later. The interface should also allow them to leave a comment about their day when they submit their details, 
and to rate their visit on a scale of one to ten.

The technical requirements:
It is expected that the web interface will be displayed on either a standard HD monitor or equivalent resolution tablet displayed in the entrance hall.
Assume that there will always be an internet connection, local storage is not required.
The application must consist of a web front-end, a back-end API written using C# and a database for storage of the data.
The application must be created within a Git repository hosted on Github (or equivalent) for Robertson Cooper to be able to assess your approach and coding style. 
It is expected that all commits from the creation of the app through to completion will be visible.

Notes:
The link in the top left takes you to an "admin" page where records can be viewed, edited and deleted.

Future improvements:
Adding a comment would give a success/thank you message and then return to the 'Add Comment' page.
